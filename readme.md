# Text-to-Speech Synthesis System

This project discusses on development of a text to speech synthesizing system based on Natural Language Processing.

Text is given to the system either as a direct input or by uploading the file. The file uploaded can be of different extensions (.txt, .pdf, .docx). Firstly, the text from that uploaded file is extracted, and then it is analyzed and processed by dividing into sentences and further dividing into tokens, removal of unwanted symbols, pause in white space and abbreviation handling. This processed text is now converted into a synthesized speech using Pyttsx3 module.

This system can be used by everyone who wants to listen text documents instead of reading them. Text files can be easily translated into audio with the help of our system. People with learning disabilities who have difficulty reading large amounts of text due to dyslexia or other problems really benefit from TTS, offering them an easier option for experiencing contents. Those readers suffering from these problems gets benefit from this TTS system.

For those users tired of reading the documents can get real benefit from this software. Also, users exposed to digital gadgets for long time can enjoy this system which provides real time natural listening sound. Synthesized speech can be used also in many educational situations. It can be used for special tasks like spelling and pronunciation teaching. It can also be used with interactive educational applications.
